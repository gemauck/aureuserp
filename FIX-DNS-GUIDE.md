# Complete Fix Guide - Connect Your Domain to DigitalOcean

## ðŸŽ¯ The Problem
Your domain `aureus.abcotronics.co.za` points to a **LiteSpeed server** (IP: 41.222.32.15)
Your Laravel app is deployed on **DigitalOcean** (different server)
â†’ That's why you're getting 404!

## âœ… The Solution (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Find Your DigitalOcean App URL

1. Open: https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps
2. Click on your **AureusERP** app
3. At the top, you'll see a URL like:
   ```
   https://aureuserp-xxxxx.ondigitalocean.app
   ```
   OR
   ```
   https://seasoned-wind-xxxxx.ondigitalocean.app
   ```
4. **Copy that URL!**

### Step 2: Test It Works

Open that URL in your browser with `/admin` at the end:
```
https://your-app-xxxxx.ondigitalocean.app/admin
```

**You should see:** âœ… Filament login page!

If you see the login page, your app is working! Just need to point your domain.

### Step 3: Update Your DNS

#### Where to Update DNS
Your domain `abcotronics.co.za` is registered somewhere. Go to:
- Your domain registrar (where you bought the domain)
- OR your DNS provider (Cloudflare, etc.)

#### What to Change

Find the DNS records for `aureus.abcotronics.co.za` and:

**Option A: CNAME (Recommended)**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: aureus
Value: aureuserp-xxxxx.ondigitalocean.app (your DigitalOcean URL without https://)
TTL: 3600
```

**Option B: A Record (Alternative)**
1. In DigitalOcean, go to: Settings â†’ Domains
2. Add your custom domain: `aureus.abcotronics.co.za`
3. DigitalOcean will give you an IP address
4. In your DNS provider:
   ```
   Type: A
   Name: aureus
   Value: [DigitalOcean IP]
   TTL: 3600
   ```

### Step 4: Wait for DNS Propagation

- Usually takes: **5-30 minutes**
- Can take up to: 24 hours (rare)

### Step 5: Test Your Domain

After 10-15 minutes, test:
```
https://aureus.abcotronics.co.za/admin
```

Should now show: âœ… **Filament login page!**

## ðŸš€ Quick Start Commands

Run these after you find your DigitalOcean URL:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_DO_URL with your actual DigitalOcean URL
export DO_URL="your-app-xxxxx.ondigitalocean.app"

# Test DigitalOcean (should work)
curl -I https://$DO_URL/admin

# Test your domain (will work after DNS update)
curl -I https://aureus.abcotronics.co.za/admin
```

## ðŸ“‹ Checklist

- [ ] Found DigitalOcean URL at cloud.digitalocean.com/apps
- [ ] Tested URL/admin - saw Filament login page âœ…
- [ ] Updated DNS CNAME to point to DigitalOcean
- [ ] Waited 15 minutes for DNS propagation
- [ ] Tested aureus.abcotronics.co.za/admin - works! ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸ†˜ If DigitalOcean URL Also Shows 404

If even the DigitalOcean URL shows 404, then run in the DigitalOcean console:

```bash
php artisan route:list | grep admin
php artisan optimize:clear
```

But most likely it's working - we just need DNS updated!
