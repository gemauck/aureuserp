# üö® URGENT: Application Deployment Issue

## Current Status: SITE IS DOWN ‚ùå

All routes are returning 404 errors. This is **NOT** a routing configuration issue - **your application is not deployed or not running properly**.

## Diagnosis Results

```
‚úó Homepage:          404
‚úó Admin panel:       404  
‚úó Admin login:       404
‚úó Customer panel:    404
‚úó index.php:         404
‚úó Static files:      404
‚úó CSS assets:        404
```

**Server:** LiteSpeed (showing LiteSpeed error page)  
**Problem:** LiteSpeed cannot find the application at all

## Critical Issue

When EVERYTHING returns 404 (including `index.php` and static files), it means:

1. ‚ùå The application is **not deployed** to the server
2. ‚ùå The **document root is wrong** (pointing to wrong directory)
3. ‚ùå The application files are **not accessible** to the web server
4. ‚ùå The deployment **completely failed**

This is different from a routing issue where `/admin` fails but `/` works.

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### Step 1: Check Your Hosting Dashboard

**You need to check your hosting platform (DigitalOcean/cPanel/Plesk/etc):**

1. Is the deployment showing as "Running" or "Failed"?
2. Are there error messages in the dashboard?
3. Did the last deployment complete successfully?
4. What's the status of the application?

### Step 2: Check Deployment Logs

Look for errors in your deployment/build logs. Common errors:
- `composer install` failed
- Missing PHP extensions
- Out of memory during build
- Permission denied errors
- Missing environment variables

### Step 3: Verify Document Root

**CRITICAL:** Check your server configuration:

Your document root MUST point to the `public/` subdirectory:
- ‚úÖ Correct: `/var/www/html/public` or `/workspace/public` or `/app/public`
- ‚ùå Wrong: `/var/www/html` or `/workspace` or `/app`

**If using LiteSpeed:**
- Check your virtual host configuration
- Ensure document root ends with `/public`
- Verify `.htaccess` in public/ directory is readable

### Step 4: Check If Files Are Actually There

If you have SSH/console access:

```bash
# Check if application files exist
ls -la /path/to/your/app/
ls -la /path/to/your/app/public/
ls -la /path/to/your/app/public/index.php

# Check if vendor directory exists (composer install ran)
ls -la /path/to/your/app/vendor/

# Check file ownership and permissions
ls -la /path/to/your/app/public/

# Try to run Laravel directly
cd /path/to/your/app
php artisan about
```

## Platform-Specific Fixes

### If Using DigitalOcean App Platform

1. Go to your app dashboard
2. Check "Runtime Logs" for errors
3. Check "Build Logs" for deployment failures
4. Try **"Force Rebuild and Deploy"** under Actions
5. Verify environment variables are set (especially `APP_KEY`)
6. Check that your app spec has correct settings:
   - Build command should include `composer install`
   - Run command should start the web server
   - Document root should be `public/`

### If Using cPanel/Plesk

1. Check the document root in domain settings
2. Must point to `public/` subdirectory
3. Check if `.htaccess` files are enabled
4. Verify PHP version (Laravel requires PHP 8.1+)
5. Check error logs in cPanel

### If Using VPS/Custom Server

1. Check web server configuration (Apache/nginx/LiteSpeed)
2. Verify virtual host document root
3. Check file permissions: `chmod -R 755 /path/to/app`
4. Check ownership: `chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/app` (or appropriate user)
5. Restart web server
6. Check error logs: `/var/log/apache2/` or `/var/log/nginx/` or LiteSpeed logs

## Configuration Files to Check

### 1. Check Procfile (if using)

Current Procfile:
```
web: vendor/bin/heroku-php-apache2 public/
```

This is for **Heroku/Heroku-style platforms** only. If you're on:
- **LiteSpeed**: You likely DON'T need a Procfile
- **cPanel/Plesk**: You DON'T need a Procfile
- **Custom VPS**: You DON'T need a Procfile

### 2. Check .htaccess

File: `public/.htaccess`

Should contain Laravel's rewrite rules (currently present ‚úì)

### 3. Check Virtual Host Configuration

**For LiteSpeed**, you need a virtual host configured:

```apache
DocumentRoot /path/to/aureuserp/public
<Directory /path/to/aureuserp/public>
    Options -Indexes +FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
</Directory>
```

## What We Fixed (For Later)

I already fixed the **CustomerPanel path conflict** issue:
- Changed from `/` to `/customer` to avoid conflicts
- This will prevent future 404s on `/admin`

**BUT** these fixes won't help until the application is actually deployed and running.

## Action Plan

1. **FIRST:** Get the application deployed and running (see above steps)
2. **THEN:** Deploy the panel path fixes I made:
   ```bash
   bash deploy-fix.sh
   ```
3. **THEN:** Clear caches and test:
   ```bash
   bash test-deployment.sh
   ```

## Commands to Run Once Deployed

Once the application is actually deployed and you have console access:

```bash
# Clear all caches
php artisan optimize:clear

# Regenerate caches
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan filament:optimize

# Verify routes exist
php artisan route:list | grep admin

# Check application status
php artisan about
```

## How to Identify Your Hosting Setup

**Not sure what hosting you're using?** Check:

1. **DigitalOcean App Platform**: 
   - URL is like `*.ondigitalocean.app`
   - Has deployment dashboard at cloud.digitalocean.com
   - Uses Procfile and buildpacks

2. **cPanel/Plesk**:
   - Has web interface like `yourdomain.com:2083` or `:8443`
   - File manager in web interface
   - Domain configuration in web interface

3. **Custom VPS**:
   - You configured the server yourself
   - SSH access required for everything
   - You installed Apache/nginx/LiteSpeed manually

4. **Shared Hosting**:
   - FTP access to upload files
   - Control panel for configuration
   - Limited command line access

## Critical Questions to Answer

1. **What hosting platform are you using?**
2. **Can you access the hosting dashboard?**
3. **Do you have SSH/console access?**
4. **What do the deployment logs say?**
5. **What's the document root set to?**

## Need Help?

Provide this information:
1. Hosting platform name
2. Screenshot of dashboard showing deployment status
3. Deployment/build logs (if available)
4. Output of `ls -la` in your application directory (if SSH access)
5. Web server configuration (if accessible)
