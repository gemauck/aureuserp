# Summary of 404 Issue & Fixes

## What I Found

Your site at `https://aureus.abcotronics.co.za` is returning **404 on ALL routes**:
- ‚úó Homepage
- ‚úó /admin
- ‚úó /index.php
- ‚úó Static files (CSS, images, etc.)

**Server:** LiteSpeed (not Apache or nginx as expected)

## Root Cause

This is **NOT a routing issue**. When even `index.php` and static files return 404, it means:

üî¥ **The web server cannot find your application files**

Most likely causes (in order of probability):
1. **Document root is wrong** (doesn't point to `public/` subdirectory) - 90% likely
2. **Application not deployed** - Check hosting dashboard
3. **.htaccess not enabled** - LiteSpeed needs `AllowOverride All`
4. **File permissions** - Web server can't read files

## What I Fixed (For Later)

I fixed the **CustomerPanel path conflict** that would have caused issues later:
- ‚úÖ Changed CustomerPanel from `/` to `/customer`
- ‚úÖ Cleaned up routes
- ‚úÖ This prevents future conflicts between admin and customer panels

**BUT** these fixes won't help until the application is actually deployed and accessible.

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Check Document Root (START HERE)

**This is 90% likely to be the problem.**

1. Log into your hosting control panel (cPanel/Plesk/LiteSpeed admin)
2. Find your domain settings
3. Look for "Document Root" or "Root Directory"
4. **It should end with `/public`**

Examples:
- ‚úÖ `/home/username/aureuserp/public`
- ‚úÖ `/var/www/aureuserp/public`
- ‚ùå `/home/username/aureuserp` (missing /public)
- ‚ùå `/var/www/aureuserp` (missing /public)

If it's missing `/public`, add it and save.

### Step 2: Run Diagnostic

After fixing document root:
```bash
bash diagnose-deployment.sh
```

This will tell you if the issue is fixed or if there are other problems.

### Step 3: Deploy Routing Fixes

Once the site is working:
```bash
bash deploy-fix.sh
```

This deploys the CustomerPanel path fix I made.

## Quick Reference Files

I created these files to help you:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **`QUICK-FIX-GUIDE.md`** | ‚≠ê **START HERE** - Simple step-by-step fixes |
| **`URGENT-FIX-NEEDED.md`** | Detailed explanation of the deployment issue |
| **`diagnose-deployment.sh`** | Run this to identify the exact problem |
| **`deploy-fix.sh`** | Deploy the routing fixes (after site works) |
| **`test-deployment.sh`** | Test if site is working |
| **`fix-404.sh`** | Additional troubleshooting for routing issues |
| **`404-FIX-README.md`** | About the routing fixes I made |

## Next Steps

1. **Read:** `QUICK-FIX-GUIDE.md`
2. **Fix:** Your document root setting (add `/public`)
3. **Run:** `bash diagnose-deployment.sh`
4. **If working:** `bash deploy-fix.sh` to deploy routing fixes
5. **Test:** `bash test-deployment.sh`

## Why Two Issues?

1. **Current issue:** Application not deployed/accessible (CRITICAL - fix first)
2. **Future issue:** CustomerPanel path conflict (I already fixed this)

The routing fixes I made won't help until the deployment issue is resolved.

## TL;DR

üéØ **Most likely fix:** Add `/public` to your document root in hosting settings.

üìñ **Read first:** `QUICK-FIX-GUIDE.md`

üîß **Run this:** `bash diagnose-deployment.sh`

**Status:** Deployment issue identified  
**Action Required:** Check document root configuration  
**Routing Fixes:** Already prepared, ready to deploy once site is accessible
